              Because we believe its ok to fail as long as we&apos;re learning
              as we go, we&apos;re aware that we&apos;ll get things wrong and
              make mistakes on our journey with helping kids to say &apos;I like
              math&apos;. If you&apos;ve got idea ideas on how we can continue
              to improve, we&apos;d love to hear from you.
            </p>

              from you. Feedback about how we&apos;re impacting kids lives is
              what energises us to keep going. Thanks so much to everyone who
